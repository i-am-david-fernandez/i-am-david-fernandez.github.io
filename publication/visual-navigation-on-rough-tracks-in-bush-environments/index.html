<meta name="description" content="Natural environments can be very challenging workspaces for humans and machines. Unlike urban environments that are designed, built and maintained by man, natural environments can appear random and arbitrary, with little or none of the structure, regularity or consistency that so often makes even the simplest tasks achievable. Bush environments are essentially natural environments, though often some structure does exist in the form of the many rough tracks – often referred to simply as dirt roads – that have been cut into the landscape to allow easier access, sometimes for bushfire control, for example. These environments, typified by State and National Parks that cover much of Australia’s south-east regions, present a worth-while challenge to the field of robotics. These areas are the common workplace of a number of important groups, notably fire-fighters, search and rescue personnel and park and forest management personnel from Australian departments and authorities. Around the globe, similar local agencies – such as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in the United States – perform largely the same duties in very similar environments. These people work in a difficult environment, often in time-critical and life-threatening operations. With a very small number of people trying to manage a very large area of land, help in the form of autonomous or semi-autonomous robots could be of great benefit.

The work presented in this thesis aims to address the problem of how navigation may be performed in bush environments, specifically navigation along poorly structured dirt roads. To be efficient (in terms of say energy consumption or mission time) and to give the highest chance of mission success, navigation should make use of roads whenever possible, as they are far more likely to offer safe and unhindered and hence rapid travel than the alternative of trekking cross-country. Because of the irregularity, inconsistency and low level of structure exhibited by dirt roads, traditional urban road-following techniques that make use of painted road markings and consistent road geometry are simply not applicable. Instead, alternative methods must be employed that can handle these and other uncontrollable environmental conditions. With the budgets of relevant agencies often stretched, cost is an important factor, as is mechanical simplicity. In balancing these requirements against adequate sensing requirements, the choice was made to use passive vision only, that is, only simple, cheap and commonly available cameras are to be used to provide the necessary input, coupled with standard computing equipment to perform processing. Comparatively expensive and often complex sensors using lasers, sonar or active vision are avoided." />

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract"><p>Natural environments can be very challenging workspaces for humans and machines. Unlike urban environments that are designed, built and maintained by man, natural environments can appear random and arbitrary, with little or none of the structure, regularity or consistency that so often makes even the simplest tasks achievable. Bush environments are essentially natural environments, though often some structure does exist in the form of the many rough tracks – often referred to simply as dirt roads – that have been cut into the landscape to allow easier access, sometimes for bushfire control, for example. These environments, typified by State and National Parks that cover much of Australia’s south-east regions, present a worth-while challenge to the field of robotics. These areas are the common workplace of a number of important groups, notably fire-fighters, search and rescue personnel and park and forest management personnel from Australian departments and authorities. Around the globe, similar local agencies – such as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in the United States – perform largely the same duties in very similar environments. These people work in a difficult environment, often in time-critical and life-threatening operations. With a very small number of people trying to manage a very large area of land, help in the form of autonomous or semi-autonomous robots could be of great benefit.</p>
<p>The work presented in this thesis aims to address the problem of how navigation may be performed in bush environments, specifically navigation along poorly structured dirt roads. To be efficient (in terms of say energy consumption or mission time) and to give the highest chance of mission success, navigation should make use of roads whenever possible, as they are far more likely to offer safe and unhindered and hence rapid travel than the alternative of trekking cross-country. Because of the irregularity, inconsistency and low level of structure exhibited by dirt roads, traditional urban road-following techniques that make use of painted road markings and consistent road geometry are simply not applicable. Instead, alternative methods must be employed that can handle these and other uncontrollable environmental conditions. With the budgets of relevant agencies often stretched, cost is an important factor, as is mechanical simplicity. In balancing these requirements against adequate sensing requirements, the choice was made to use passive vision only, that is, only simple, cheap and commonly available cameras are to be used to provide the necessary input, coupled with standard computing equipment to perform processing. Comparatively expensive and often complex sensors using lasers, sonar or active vision are avoided.</p>
