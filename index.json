[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am an Engineer and I love Engineering. Whether in a professional context dealing with software and electrical systems or at home as an amateur gardener setting up a micro spray system for a vegetable garden, I love the challenge of finding and implementing practical, efficient and effective solutions to real-world problems using systematic techniques coupled with creativity.\nI have a keen interest in the development of systems and technologies that blend mechanical, electrical and electronic systems with software-based computation and the application of computational intelligence to problems in general.\nProfessionally, my primary interest is Software Engineering, creating software systems that solve real-world problems and improve reliability, robustness and efficiency through automation. Peripherally, I am interested in helping businesses formalise and automate their workflows and secure their information to help ensure processes are efficient, effective, repeatable and reliable.\nUnderneath it all, I simply like making things that solve problems, both my own and those of others. In another time, I perhaps may have been a blacksmith.\n My hammer is a keyboard, my anvil a workstation, and my steel is an alloy of ones and zeros.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am an Engineer and I love Engineering.
