My requirements/constraints for use are as follows:\nBoth devices run Windows 10, so the solution must work in this environment. I do not need to work on both devices simultaneously. I will generally only use one device on any given day (i.e., will switch devices at most once per day). I do not wish for complications or performance hits within work sessions. I don’t mind some up-front complications. I don’t mind some performance hits (e.g., extra time) between work sessions. I almost exclusively use Vagrant by HashiCorp to manage my virtual machines, and VirtualBox by Oracle as the hypervisor, so my solution must work with these tools. Broadly, this rules out solutions like working from an external drive (I don’t, for example, want to need to drag the drive around with me if I need to move the laptop to another area for a short time), but allows for a solution that requires data to be copied between devices when switching devices.\nThe process I’ve engineered to achieve this is initially convoluted, but it seems to work. The complications are primarily during initial setup; thereafter there’s not much to do beyond copy/sync files, and for that I’ve found FreeFileSync to be very useful.\nSetup/Initialisation Ensure the box is explicitly given a name, such that it will be identical on all devices within VirtualBox, i.e., within the Vagrantfile: config.vm.provider \u0026#34;virtualbox\u0026#34; do |vb| vb.name = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt;\u0026#34; Ensure the exact same VirtualBox path is used on both machines. In my use, the laptop and desktop are quite differently configured. In particular, the laptop has a single drive and working partition (the ubiquitous C:) while the desktop has a multitude of drives and partitions, with my virtual machines residing on F:. To allow the same path to be used on both machines, I use a drive-mapped folder (see Map a Folder to a Drive Letter for Quick and Easy Access • Raymond.CC), using the same drive on both devices but different mapped folders. e.g.:\nDesktop: V: –\u0026gt; \\??\\F:\\davidfernandez\\Virtualisation\\Machines\\VirtualBox Laptop: V: –\u0026gt; \\??\\C:\\Users\\davidfernandez\\Virtualisation\\Machines\\VirtualBox I use the registry-based method described in the article linked above, so an appropriate .reg file for the desktop would be:\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\DOS Devices] \u0026#34;V:\u0026#34;=\u0026#34;\\\\??\\\\F:\\\\davidfernandez\\\\Virtualisation\\\\Machines\\\\VirtualBox\u0026#34; On Device A, create the box via vagrant up. If using the folder mapping trick (above), change VirtualBox’s machine folder before creating the machine: VBoxManage.exe setproperty machinefolder V: Remember to reset/revert this afterwards. Perform provisioning steps on Device A as required. On Device B, create the box via vagrant up, but (for efficiency) do not provision. Again, if using folder mapping, change VirtualBox’s machine folder before creating the machine. Transfer material from Device A to Device B: All VirtualBox files (e.g., *.vbox, *.vmdk etc.) All .vagrant/machines/\u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt; files except: .vagrant/machines/\u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt;/virtualbox/synced_folders .vagrant/machines/\u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt;/virtualbox/vagrant_cwd These files contain device-specific paths (the host location of shared folders and the host location of the Vagrant project) and are best left matched to the device. On Device B: Replace the uuid value for the MachineRegistry/MachineEntry entry for the box in ~/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml to match the value in the corresponding file on Device A. In other words, this XML element should be the same on both device’s configuration, with the existing uuid on Device A use in both: \u0026lt;MachineEntry uuid=\u0026#34;{4b62d0e5-cf93-48de-8be2-460562b87fbf}\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;V:\\\u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt;\\\u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt;.vbox\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; Notes This seems to break vagrant’s ability to connect via ssh (i.e., specifically vagrant ssh fails, seeming due to a bad keypair). However, as I don’t use vagrant’s ssh capabilities (that is, I connect via ssh using other tools), this doesn’t bother me and I have not spent time trying to resolve this. If you know what might be causing this specifically, and/or know a solution, let me know so I can update this post.\nOngoing Sync Thereafter, it should be sufficient to simply synchronise the files listed in step 6 above.\nTo improve efficiency of syncing, I find it useful to use snapshots. Without this, synchronising means (possibly1) transferring all virtual disk files/data. Using snapshots means you only transfer the virtual disks changed after the most recent snapshot.\nConclusion The setup steps for this arrangement are a bit fiddly, but only need to be done once (per machine you wish to synchronise). Thereafter, maintaining synchronicity is quite straightforward. I’ve been using this setup for a while now, and, other than the non-working vagrant-based ssh, everything works as expected. Hopefully this setup can be of …","date":1583205569,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583205569,"objectID":"af053a6b7f7d5a30faa58f98fb23d546","permalink":"https://i-am-david-fernandez.github.io/post/synchronising_a_virtual_machine_across_devices/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T14:19:29+11:00","relpermalink":"/post/synchronising_a_virtual_machine_across_devices/","section":"post","summary":"I have a need to use a single virtual machine on two devices, in particular a laptop and a desktop machine.

Much of this might seem overkill for a home lab, but part of the point of having a home lab is having a place and projects in and with which I can practice, refine and extend my skills and knowledge in areas that might otherwise be considered the domain of a “professional”, of some sort1.\nI won’t be presenting any code or code-like material here (that may come in subsequent posts), but will instead focus on my choice of tooling and methods. Also, note that this isn’t a tutorial on how to use any of these tools – your favourite search engine will find those for you – but rather a higher-level picture of how these different tools can be used together to solve a larger problem.\nOverview In general, I’m not a big fan of ad-hoc management of systems (e.g., servers) that handle anything remotely important. I like to automate (which then becomes documentation of sorts) and version-control. This aids greatly in problem-solving (if something goes wrong, the automation side can tell you exactly what was done, the revision control can let you go back to a working state) and repeatability (you might not ever need an exact duplicate of a system, but in my experience there are very often shared subsets).\nI do, however, like the ability to experiment and play before settling on a solution, especially when I’m working with something new and unfamiliar. Having a way to try something, knowing you can either undo what you’ve done if you’re not happy, or be able to exactly replicate if you are, is invaluable.\nTo achieve this, I make use of virtualisation technologies and automated provisioning systems.\nVirtualisation Virtualisation is used to provide what is essentially a simulated2 copy of the real environment. Within this environment, you can freely change things without worrying about messing up an otherwise functioning system. Using features like snapshotting, you can also create “known good” bookmarks of the system, that is, complete copies of the system state, to which you can return if and when required. In this manner, you can develop iteratively and progressively:\ngraph TB;\rA(Base System)\rB[Create Snapshot]\rC[Revert Snapshot]\rD(Snapshot)\rE[Modify]\rF{Happy?}\rG{Complete?}\rH(Done!)\rA --\u0026gt; B\rB --\u0026gt; D\rC --\u0026gt; D\rD --\u0026gt; E\rE --\u0026gt; F\rF -- no --\u0026gt; C\rF -- yes --\u0026gt; G\rG -- no --\u0026gt; B\rG -- yes --\u0026gt; H You essentially develop within a loop, starting with a known-good snapshot (which is initially created from whatever your starting point is), making changes, and either creating a new snapshot (if you’re happy with the changes) or reverting to the prior snapshot state (undoing) if you’re not happy. Rinse and repeat until your snapshot is your desired end state.\nBecause the system is virtual, and the snapshots are complete system states, you can afford to be as aggressive in your experimenting as you like. Completely messed up the (virtual) partition table? Meh. Revert.\nAn important caveat to this is that a virtual system will only be an approximation of the real system in terms of hardware. For many use-cases, perhaps most, this will be close enough. Limiting the available resources (disk space, RAM, CPU) within the virtual machine to match the real system can be plenty good enough (e.g., can let you know if you’re pushing the system beyond what the real machine could handle). If, however, your system involves some particular hardware (not just that the system has some particular hardware, but that your use of it requires that particular hardware), then the virtual machine may not suffice.\nTo reiterate, virtualisation provides a controlled and reproduceable environment and context for development and experimentation.\nAutomated Provisioning Automated provisioning is the process of using programmable tools to perform a variety of system setup operations, largely installing and configuring software packages. The notion of programmable tools here means you programatically define – whether by scripts, “recipes”, or some form of configuration file – what the tool should do. For example, to create a set of users, you might define a list of user specifications (each comprising a username, initial password and e-mail address) and specify that a “new user” operation be performed for each member of that list.\nIn this manner, the system is provisioned – e.g., users are created – according to a program that can be applied consistently. There is no need to remember the details of each user, nor the process of creating them. Especially when combined with a staging environment3 such as the virtual machine described above, this method and mechanisms can provide a high degree of reliability and quality assurance, as the programmatic nature removes a key source of problems: human error4.\nThe automated provisioning process becomes the work performed in the “Modify” block in the diagram above.\nThat’s How I Role Having …","date":1566081363,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566081363,"objectID":"9d9a03883ba7b22ccb3386255a9056e8","permalink":"https://i-am-david-fernandez.github.io/post/homelab/virtualisation_and_provisioning/","publishdate":"2019-08-18T08:36:03+10:00","relpermalink":"/post/homelab/virtualisation_and_provisioning/","section":"post","summary":"This post describes the broad approach I have taken to setting-up and configuring the software system of my current primary home server (Mammoth).

I would argue that it should be of interest to anyone and everyone involved in managing or handling data, especially that of other people1, which pretty much means almost everyone working in software development or information technology more generally. It should also include anyone making choices about what software or systems they use to manage data, even if that’s not part of their job description.\nTLDR;\nDefinitions As a first point, I should clarify what I mean by information security, as varying definitions exist. I tend to follow the definition provided in ISO/IEC 270002:\ndefinition 3.28: preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information\nAs noted in the footnote to that definition, other properties, such as authenticity and reliability, can also be involved, though, for the moment at least, I will maintain focus on the three above.\nThese properties will be relevant to all users of data, though the requirements can vary widely and this must be understood.\nIntegrity definition 3.36: property of accuracy and completeness2\nBroadly speaking I consider data integrity to simply mean that the data is what you expect it to be, which generally means that, for a given piece of data, what you read tomorrow is what you3 wrote today.\nAlmost all users will have about the same integrity requirements: they want the data they retrieve to be the data they saved. They do not want the data to be changed in unexpected ways, whether as a result of malicious action (e.g., “hacking”), user error (e.g., accidental deletion), or system failure (e.g., a hardware crash).\nThat said, there may be some instances where this isn’t strictly true. An example may be an image storage system whereby uploaded images are (re-)compressed in a lossy manner (e.g., JPEG compression) in order to reduce size (and hence, perhaps, allow the user to store more images).4 In this case, what the user later retrieves (the compressed image) is not exactly bit-for-bit the same as that which they sent for storage.\nAvailability definition 3.7: property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity2\nIn simple terms, I consider this to mean that everyone that should have access to the data is able to get it in a timely manner.\nAvailability requirements will differ: some users will want/need data immediately5, some don’t mind to wait. All want to get it eventually though.\nConfidentiality definition 3.10: property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes2\nI consider this to mean that access to data – including, in some cases, mere knowledge of the existence of the data – can be restricted and controlled.\nConfidentiality requirements will differ: some don’t care who has access6, some want all to access (e.g., someone in marketing may want as many people as possible to view their pitch), some want strict controls (few people want anyone but themselves and perhaps their bank to see their bank records).\nAuthenticity One of the “other properties” mentioned in the opening information security definition that I’d like to expand on is authenticity.\ndefinition 3.6: property that an entity is what it claims to be2\nI like to think of this in terms of trust or provenance, that is, being able to trust, verify or confirm the stated source of data.\nAs with all the other properties, requirements will vary. In some instances, as long as access-control mechanisms are in place (i.e., only authorised users have access), it may not matter which specific authorised user has modified data. In other cases (such as a hospital patient’s medication requirements), knowing exactly which user made the changes – and possibly knowing the entire change history – is of critical importance.\nLax Approach (not the airport) Too often, it seems, information security is an afterthought. It isn’t often part of a user’s core requirements (they want to use the data to do things that are important to them), though this is changing as more people become aware of what can happen when information is not secured. As a result of this lack of user pressure, the need to keep information secure can fall by the wayside (market pressures can mean it is sometimes difficult to justify spending resources investigating/developing features that the user won’t explicitly demand).\nIn many instances, I believe that information security is seen as non-critical because of the parallels drawn with physical security, e.g., physical locks and keys on doors. By and large, physical security mechanisms exist to protect physical resources from theft, damage or other such malicious acts. To prioritise security of this form essentially requires belief that a) one has resources worth protecting, and b) there exist malicious others that would try to gain access to those resources. In the world of information, I suggest that most people can evaluate the first point well enough7, …","date":1565490229,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565673358,"objectID":"150801da1873ee2f3470dcb202ad2ea0","permalink":"https://i-am-david-fernandez.github.io/post/infosec/information-security-00/","publishdate":"2019-08-11T12:23:49+10:00","relpermalink":"/post/infosec/information-security-00/","section":"post","summary":"Information Security is something that interests me.

Unlike urban environments that are designed, built and maintained by man, natural environments can appear random and arbitrary, with little or none of the structure, regularity or consistency that so often makes even the simplest tasks achievable. Bush environments are essentially natural environments, though often some structure does exist in the form of the many rough tracks – often referred to simply as dirt roads – that have been cut into the landscape to allow easier access, sometimes for bushfire control, for example. These environments, typified by State and National Parks that cover much of Australia’s south-east regions, present a worth-while challenge to the field of robotics. These areas are the common workplace of a number of important groups, notably fire-fighters, search and rescue personnel and park and forest management personnel from Australian departments and authorities. Around the globe, similar local agencies – such as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in the United States – perform largely the same duties in very similar environments. These people work in a difficult environment, often in time-critical and life-threatening operations. With a very small number of people trying to manage a very large area of land, help in the form of autonomous or semi-autonomous robots could be of great benefit.\n\nThe work presented in this thesis aims to address the problem of how navigation may be performed in bush environments, specifically navigation along poorly structured dirt roads. To be efficient (in terms of say energy consumption or mission time) and to give the highest chance of mission success, navigation should make use of roads whenever possible, as they are far more likely to offer safe and unhindered and hence rapid travel than the alternative of trekking cross-country. Because of the irregularity, inconsistency and low level of structure exhibited by dirt roads, traditional urban road-following techniques that make use of painted road markings and consistent road geometry are simply not applicable. Instead, alternative methods must be employed that can handle these and other uncontrollable environmental conditions. With the budgets of relevant agencies often stretched, cost is an important factor, as is mechanical simplicity. In balancing these requirements against adequate sensing requirements, the choice was made to use passive vision only, that is, only simple, cheap and commonly available cameras are to be used to provide the necessary input, coupled with standard computing equipment to perform processing. Comparatively expensive and often complex sensors using lasers, sonar or active vision are avoided.","tags":[],"title":"Visual navigation on rough tracks in bush environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Areas that appear simple to humans can be very difficult for a robot to accurately and consistently describe. Poorly structured dirt roads, such as fire-access tracks and bush-walking tracks, are often overlooked in research but are highly important passageways for emergency support crews, such as search-and-rescue teams and firefighters tackling bush fires. This paper presents a method of autonomously detecting and hence tracking such roads using colour vision. Central to the process is a method of characterising the road surface through a statistical colour description, which makes minimal assumptions about the road. A highly simplified and generalised road model is used to ignore the background and contain the road, and weighted control points are used to generate a spline-based trajectory along the road, which is intended to be used for motion-control of a robot trying to traverse these tracks. Inherent to the system is the avoidance or safe traversal of certain types of obstacles. The combination of simple modelling and efficient processing algorithms has resulted in a usable average processing speed of approximately eight frames per second on the 1.7 GHz Pentium-4 test machine","tags":[],"title":"Visual detection and tracking of poorly structured dirt roads","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

The solution consists of the use of vision and pseudo-optical flow techniques to make motion estimates of a camera attached to the robot chassis. The use of vision makes the system independent of locomotion (for example, the differences between a robot with wheels and one with legs) and is shown to be applicable to a variety or outdoor ground surfaces, such as tarmac, gravel, grass and dirt. Finally, the simplified calculations result in high processing speeds on moderate equipment, with experiments showing that high speed motion (approximately 300 degree per second rotations and 350 millimetre per second translations) can be reliably estimated.","tags":[],"title":"Visual odometry for an outdoor mobile robot","type":"publication"}]
