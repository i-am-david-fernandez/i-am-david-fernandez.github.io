      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an Engineer and I love Engineering. Whether in a professional context dealing with software and electrical systems or at home as an amateur gardener setting up a micro spray system for a vegetable garden, I love the challenge of finding and implementing practical, efficient and effective solutions to real-world problems using systematic techniques coupled with creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary interest is Software Engineering, creating software systems that solve real-world problems and improve reliability, robustness and efficiency through automation. Peripherally, I am interested in helping businesses formalise and automate their workflows and secure their information to help ensure processes are efficient, effective, repeatable and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I have a keen interest in the development of systems and technologies that blend mechanical, electrical and electronic systems with software-based computation and the application of computational intelligence to problems in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My hammer is a keyboard, my anvil a workstation, and my steel is an alloy of ones and zeros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
